<div class="titles"><br>Executive Summary</div>
<br>
We strive to grow and expand beyond our current line of products, to ensure the well-being of our community as much as we can. “We are dedicated to providing delicious servings of food to allow people to enjoy their lives to the fullest extent without the pains of cooking.”
Citing our mission statement, the first concern we have in mind when doing business is allowing our customers to attain a gastronomical experience unlike any other without the associated caveats. Our ultimate goal is to see everyone in America with a MegaWave product. We aim to save consumers time and increase customer satisfaction in bakeries, restaurants, and homes. While this is our targeted market, our footprint doesn’t end there. We plan to appear in schools and teach our young generation about this groundbreaking new technology that will change our future for the better.

	<br>
 	Jeffrey Tu, the CEO makes important corporate decisions and communicates with members of the board to make sure the company runs smoothly. He also helps in maintaining the company website and development of the technology. Members of the board include the COO (Milan) who conducts tests and develops the technology, reporting results to the board. Another member of our company is the CFO (Arjun), who manages the company funds and communicates with other organizations to request grants and raise funds. The CFO also works with the COO to make sure the company does not go over budget. CDO (Alex) is the last member of the board, who designs the robot and company logos. He also works with the COO to solve technical issues they may run into while in the production phase.

<br>
In order to overtake other companies who expand on this idea we will frequently ask for our customers to describe difficulties and struggles they have with the product. In addition, because we are putting our product into bakeries and other similar establishments we will also try to get these companies to respond and tell us about the struggles and advantages of the QuickDec®. We will also add other products to automate the food industry such as a automatic fruit peeler. To make sure more people know about the QuickDec® we will make sure to put our advertisements into mainstream cooking channels to make sure the audience we advertise for will be those who are interested in the market.<br><br>

Currently we are trying to finalizing the design, working on the patent, and working with retailers.
The design is near completion thanks to constant hard work by our CDO Alex Yan. We are finishing the small changes to our design such as ways to make it more efficient in terms of energy usage and which colors are the most appealing to our potential customers.
The patent is currently pending in multiple countries such as the United States, England, and Germany.
To expand as quickly as possible we have already reached out to many large retailers such as Costco and bakeries that will use the product, such as Kara’s Cupcakes.
