			<h1>Welcome to the Megawave</h1>
			<hr/ size="3px"; color=#000aaa>
			<p><i>Hello Reader,
			My name is Jeffery Yu, and I happened to make your acquaintance at Bizcon. I am the CEO of Megawave LLC, an emerging entity in the 	food industry. </i> <mark>Our company currently produces robots that peel foods through the advanced process of peeling.</mark> <br/>
			I am asking for two million dollars to fund the initial production of our flagship machine, the QuickDec®️. We currently have five design patents and countless more utility patents pending. In exchange for your faith in our company, we will give you twenty percent of the company shares. We plan on expanding to more automated processes in the food industry, such as an automatic fruit peeler and more. 

			Please contact me if you have any questions via email at jethreetwo@gmail.com

			Sincerely, 
			Jeffery Yu
			</p>
